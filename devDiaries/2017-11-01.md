I've been wanting to properly participate in [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org/sign_up) for a while, but I also have been wanting to do beef up my programming skills.

Yesterday, I learned that there is an A.I. writing version of this program from this [tweet](https://twitter.com/molly0x57/status/925497998569885697), this Github [repository](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2017), and this Github [issue](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2017/issues/44). Since I have been also wanting to learn how to program neural nets and bot writers, I decided that this would be a fun way to do it. This will also help me to get a better handle on using git. 

My idea is to create a program that can spit out a proper AI generated novel to the web. I would train it on the greats of the Western canon (in the public domain, of course, scraped from Project Gutenberg and based on Hillsdale College's list ), and then generate 50,000 words based on an algorithm. Depending on software that I use, I might need to plot out per chapters, etc. I'm not sure. I since I would serve as programmer and editor, the A.I. serves as more of a writing aid.
